**Big O Notation**
-
Big O Notation is a metric by which we can describe how efficient an Algorithm is. It is used to find out the most efficient option out of all the available ones for performing a particular operation

**Time Complexity**
-
Time complexity is a way of determinig how the runtime of an application increases with the increament in the size of input. 



**Space Complexity**
-
Space Complexity is the way of determining how the space required for the running of an application increases with the  increament in the size of input.
